                <p class="seg-text">November 2017
                    Throughout November 2017, ACT hosted a dorm competition for collecting soda tabs <br> (any tabs on
                    the
                    tops of soda cans, soup cans, veggie cans, or other aluminum cans) for the Ronald <br> McDonald
                    House
                    Charities. The dorm floors with the most soda tab donations won Insomnia cookies.<br> Overall, we
                    collected almost 9,000 soda tabs!</p>

                <p class="seg-text">Ronald McDonald House Charities
                    Donated soda tabs get recycled, helping the environment, <br> and all funds generated from recycling
                    the
                    soda tabs go directly to the Ronald McDonald House Charities <br>to offset housing costs. This
                    charity
                    buys and renovates houses close to hospitals in order for low-income <br> family members to stay in
                    cost-free housing close to their loved ones rather than sleeping in waiting room chairs. <br> There
                    are
                    currently more than 350 houses worldwide.</p>
